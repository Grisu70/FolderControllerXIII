# FolderControllerXIII
A work in progress tweak aiming to provide full customization of folders, their icons, and provide extra useful features. 
Also working on making it an "all in one" layout tweak to minimize the need for conflicting packages.  So far just uploading strings for help translating, as it has partial or full support for about 5 or 6 languages.

Tweak is currently only available for sale in YouRepo for $1. Http://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com/pack/foldercontrollerxiii 

It will be $1.99 when finished and in Packix, but half price for anyone that bought FolderControllerXII. The half price that it's selling for now is because I don't know who bought the last version because they may have bought from Packix, and it gives new users a chance to get it for a cheaper price since they got it while still in beta.

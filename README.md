# FolderControllerXIII
A work in progress tweak aiming to provide full customization of folders, their icons, and provide extra useful features. 
Also working on making it an "all in one" layout tweak to minimize the need for conflicting packages.  So far just uploading strings for help translating, as it has partial or full support for about 5 or 6 languages.

Currently only the Spanish language project is fully translated with the correct strings. 
Also, as new features are added, that will be the first language updated, as it's the second language I became fluent in over the years, and easiest for me to translate.

If you download those files, you can change the Spanish translations to your native language, leaving the English part how it is, and then create a pull request on here for your language using the edited file(s), or upload the corrected file(s) and send it to me on Twitter @BrianVS

FolderController.strings is the main file for the first page, and only needs strings that are on that page(The ones that are in spanish project es.lproj).  Extras won't hurt though.

If you don't see your native language on here, you can fork the repo and create a folder with the corresponding abbreviation.lproj and add the strings in there.

I WILL BE HAPPY TO GIFT ANY TRANSLATOR A COPY OF THE TWEAK, just contact me on Twitter @BrianVS
